		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Eamonn Kerins (JBCA)<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:In an era of large-scale surveys astrophysicists are often required to analyse vast datasets to identify and model signals of a known prior form. I will talk about how unsupervised machine learning methods can help accelerate such modelling. The Spearnet survey is using telescope networks to observe and model exoplanet atmospheres. We have developed a new hybrid method that uses machine learning to accelerate our atmospheric modelling. I'll describe the basic method and its potential for widespread application to other problems.<br>
		<span class='name'>Title</span>: Classifying Major Mergers in the CANDELS fields using a Deep Learning model trained with IllustrisTNG data.<br>
		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Leonardo Ferreira (JBCA)<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:Merging is potentially the dominant process in galaxy formation, yet there is still debate about its history over cosmic time. To address this, we classify major mergers and measure galaxy merger rates up to z∼3 in all five CANDELS fields using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We show that the model can achieve 90% accuracy when classifying mergers from the simulation and has the additional feature of separating mergers before the infall of stellar masses from post mergers. We compare the machine learning classifications on CANDELS galaxies with visual merger classifications from Kartaltepe et al. 2015, and show that they are broadly consistent. Finally, they demonstrate that galaxy merger rates measured by the model are consistent with results found for CANDELS galaxies using close pairs statistics.<br>

		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Jiani Chu (Tsinghua) and Richard Long (MU-NAOC).<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:We present AI Poincaré, a machine learning algorithm for auto-discovering conserved quantities using trajectory data from unknown dynamical systems. We test it on five Hamiltonian systems, including the gravitational 3-body problem, and find that it discovers not only all exactly conserved quantities, but also periodic orbits, phase transitions and breakdown timescales for approximate conservation laws.<br>

		<h3>(Journal club) Real-time detection of anomalies in large-scale transient surveys</h3>
		<time datetime="2021-11-08">11/8/2021</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Xiaosheng Zhao (Tsinghua).<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:New time-domain surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe millions of transient alerts each night, making standard approaches of visually identifying new and interesting transients infeasible. We present two novel methods of automatically detecting anomalous transient light curves in real-time. Both methods are based on the simple idea that if the light curves from a known population of transients can be accurately modelled, any deviations from model predictions are likely anomalies. The first modelling approach is a probabilistic neural network built using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the second is an interpretable Bayesian parametric model of a transient. We demonstrate our methods' ability to provide anomaly scores as a function of time on light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We show that the flexibility of neural networks, the attribute that makes them such a powerful tool for many regression tasks, is what makes them less suitable for anomaly detection when compared with our parametric model. The parametric model is able to identify anomalies with respect to common supernova classes with low false anomaly rates and high true anomaly rates achieving Area Under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) scores above 0.8 for most rare classes such as kilonovae, tidal disruption events, intermediate luminosity transients, and pair-instability supernovae. Our ability to identify anomalies improves over the lifetime of the light curves. Our framework, used in conjunction with transient classifiers, will enable fast and prioritised follow-up of unusual transients from new large-scale surveys.<br>

		<h3>AI-assisted super-resolution cosmological simulations</h3>
		<time datetime="2021-06-07">6/7/2021</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Yueying Ni (CMU).<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:In this work, we expand and test the capabilities of our recently developed super-resolution (SR) model to generate high-resolution (HR) realizations of the full phase-space matter distribution, including both displacement and velocity, from computationally cheap low-resolution (LR) cosmological N-body simulations. The SR model enhances the simulation resolution by generating 512 times more tracer particles, extending into the deeply non-linear regime where complex structure formation processes take place. We validate the SR model by deploying the model in 10 test simulations of box size 100 ℎ −1Mpc, and examine the matter power spectra, bispectra and 2D power spectra in redshift space. We find the generated SR field matches the true HR result at percent level down to scales of 𝑘 ∼ 10 ℎ Mpc−1 . We also identify and inspect dark matter halos and their substructures. Our SR model generate visually authentic small-scale structures, that cannot be resolved by the LR input, and are in good statistical agreement with the real HR results. The SR model performs satisfactorily on the halo occupation distribution, halo correlations in both real and redshift space, and the pairwise velocity distribution, matching the HR results with comparable scatter, thus demonstrating its potential in making mock halo catalogs. The SR technique can be a powerful and promising tool for modelling small-scale galaxy formation physics in large cosmological volumes.<br>

		<h3>(Journal club) Capturing the physics of MaNGA galaxies with self-supervised Machine Learning</h3>
		<time datetime="2021-04-26">4/26/2021</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Dandan Xu (Tsinghua).<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>: As available data sets grow in size and complexity, advanced visualization tools enabling their exploration and analysis become more important. In modern astronomy, integral field spectroscopic galaxy surveys are a clear example of increasing dimensionality and complexity of datasets, which challenge the traditional methods used to extract the physical information they contain. We present the use of a novel self-supervised Machine Learning method to visualize the multi-dimensional information on stellar population and kinematics in the MaNGA survey in a two dimensional plane. Our framework is insensitive to non-physical properties such as the size of integral field unit (IFU) and is therefore able to order galaxies according to their resolved physical properties. Using the extracted representations, we study how galaxies distribute based on their resolved and global physical properties. We show that even when using exclusively information about the internal structure, galaxies naturally cluster into two well-known categories from a purely data driven perspective: rotating main-sequence disks and massive slow rotators, hence confirming distinct assembly channels. Low-mass rotation-dominated quenched galaxies appear only as a third cluster if information about the integrated physical properties is preserved, suggesting a mixture of assembly processes for these galaxies without any particular signature in their internal kinematics that distinguishes them from the two main groups. The framework for data exploration is publicly released with this publication, ready to be used with the MaNGA or other integral field data sets.<br>

		<h3>Machine Learns AGN</h3>
		<time datetime="2021-04-12">4/12/2021</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		<span class='name'>Speaker</span>: Jiachen Jiang (Tsinghua).<br>
		<span class="name">Abstract</span>:The optical and UV variability of the majority of AGN may be related to the reprocessing of rapidly-changing X-ray emission from a more compact region near the central black hole. Such a reprocessing model would be characterised by lags between X-ray and optical/UV emission due to differences in light travel time. Observationally however, such lag features have been difficult to detect due to gaps in the lightcurves introduced through factors such as source visibility or limited telescope time. In this work, Gaussian process regression is employed to interpolate the gaps in the Swift X-ray and UV lightcurves of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335. In a simulation study of five commonly-employed analytic Gaussian process kernels, we conclude that the Matern $\frac{1}{2}$ and rational quadratic kernels yield the most well-specified models for the X-ray and UVW2 bands of Mrk 335. In analysing the structure functions of the Gaussian process lightcurves, we obtain a broken power law with a break point at 125 days in the UVW2 band. In the X-ray band, the structure function of the Gaussian process lightcurve is consistent with a power law in the case of the rational quadratic kernel whilst a broken power law with a break point at 66 days is obtained from the Matern $\frac{1}{2}$ kernel. The subsequent cross-correlation analysis is consistent with previous studies and furthermore, shows tentative evidence for a broad X-ray-UV lag feature of up to 30 days in the lag-frequency spectrum where the significance of the lag depends on the choice of Gaussian process kernel.<br>
